## Standing constraints for the fix card (read first)

- **Workspace:** the implementation's tree, `{{WORKDIR}}`. Local commits are
  required; push, PR, merge, rebase, reset, amend, revert, force and branch
  deletion are forbidden. Read `{{RULES}}` first.
- Read the review card's **raw** findings (`hermes kanban --board {{BOARD}} show
  <parent-id>`, the `F1…` list) and, on its parent, the implementation summary.
- Each finding is either applied — with a test when it is about behaviour, and a
  manual mutation check for that test — or rejected with proof: command output or
  the line of code that refutes it.
- A finding that argues with a written decision (`docs/adr/`, the spec) or changes
  a default the operator chose is **not** applied: return it as "needs decision"
  — or first ask the orchestrator on your card and wait:
  `kanban_comment(task_id=$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK, body="<finding, the decision
  needed, your default>", await_reply_minutes=10)`; the reply comes back in
  `replies`, empty means no answer.
- When a finding describes a symptom, fix every path that produces it, not only
  the one cited.
- Two failed attempts on one finding: stop on it, record it, move on.
- Evidence as you go: append every RED run and every mutation's failing and
  green output to `$TMPDIR/$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK-evidence.log` the moment you get
  it, and build the summary from that file. Your context may be compacted
  before the end; output you did not save is gone. Not in the tree: a stray
  file there fails the clean-tree check at `kanban_complete`.
- Long suites (e2e and the like) run in the background with a completion
  notice and you wait for it: a foreground call hits the tool timeout. While
  one runs, do not touch the tree — no mutations, no edits: a dev server
  reloads on the change and the running tests fail for that reason, not for
  the code. Mutations come after the suite has finished.
- Nothing to change (the review had no findings, or you rejected all of
  them): leave the tree clean and finish with `kanban_complete` carrying
  `metadata: {"no_change": "<why, one line>"}`. Never `kanban_block` for it —
  a block wakes the operator for a card that is done.
- `{{GATE}}` green at the end (last line contains `{{GATE_OK}}`); `npm run gen` a
  no-op if you added files.
- **Summary:** first line `START_HEAD..END_HEAD, N files, gate: green`, then a
  table of findings — applied / rejected (with proof) / needs decision — and the
  test output.
